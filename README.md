This repository groups the work done in the scope of the 02456 Deep Learning Course at DTU.

This is project 20: "Use Foldseek to boost training sets  prediction servers, such as  NetSurfP, by including sequence for similar structures with low sequence homology".

The project was made by Thomas Fayad (s184440) and Oskar Kristoffersen (s184364).
